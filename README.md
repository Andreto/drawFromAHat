# Draw from a hat

One day I found myself needing a program to randomly pick a name from a list. I decided I'd rather make my own than use one available on the Internet.

### Things that needs to be worked on
* I want the name to be deleted off the list when clicked on the 'x' and the 'x' only.
* allow user to edit names "in the hat" by clicking on it from the list.
